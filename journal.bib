  abstract = {Abstract The {FLASHForward} project at {DESY} is a pioneering plasma-wakefield acceleration experiment that aims to produce, in a few centimetres of ionised hydrogen, beams with energy of order GeV that are of quality sufficient to be used in a free-electron laser. The plasma is created by ionising a gas in a gas cell with a multi-TW laser system. The plasma wave will be driven by high-current-density electron beams from the {FLASH} linear accelerator. The laser system can also be used to provide optical diagnostics of the plasma and electron beams due to the &lt;30 fs synchronisation between the laser and the driving electron beam. The project will explore both external and internal witness-beam injection techniques. The operation parameters of the experiment are discussed, as well as the scientific programme.},

The {PWFA} experiment at the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ) was launched to experimentally demonstrate and study the self-modulation of long electron beams in plasma. Key aspects for the experiment are the very flexible photocathode laser system, a plasma cell and well-developed beam diagnostics.

  abstract   = {We introduce the Highly efficient Plasma Accelerator Emulation (HiPACE) code. It is a relativistic, electromagnetic, three-dimensional and fully parallelized particle-in-cell (PIC) code and uses the quasi-static approximation to efficiently simulate a variety of beam-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration scenarios. HiPACE exploits the disparity of time scales in the interaction of highly relativistic particle beams with plasma to decouple beam and plasma evolution. This enables time steps which are many times greater than those used in full PIC codes. Comparisons to the fully explicit PIC code OSIRIS show the capability of the quasi-static PIC code to consistently simulate problems in beam-driven plasma acceleration while reducing the required number of core hours by orders of magnitude. This work outlines the physical basis, describes the numerical implementation and assesses the parallel performance of the code which in combination lead to high computational efficiency.},

Results are compared to particle-in-cell simulations, establishing the accuracy and efficiency of the procedure.

  abstract={In 1867, just two years after laying the foundations of electromagnetism, J. Clerk Maxwell presented a fundamental paper on kinetic gas theory, in which he described the evolution of the gas in terms of certain ‘moments’ of its velocity distribution function. This inspired Ludwig Boltzmann to formulate his famous kinetic equation, from which followed the H -theorem and the connection with entropy. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of publication of Maxwell's paper, we review the Maxwell–Boltzmann formalism and discuss how its generality and adaptability enable it to play a key role in describing the behaviour of a variety of systems of current interest, in both gaseous and condensed matter, and in modern-day physics and technologies which Maxwell and Boltzmann could not possibly have foreseen. In particular, we illustrate the relevance and applicability of Maxwell's formalism to the dynamic field of plasma-wakefield acceleration.}

This topic will be studied at FLASHForward, a unique beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration facility currently under construction at {DESY} (Hamburg, Germany), in the frame of the {FLASHForward} X-2 experiment. High-quality 1 GeV-class electron beams from the free-electron laser {FLASH} with $\mu$m-emittances, kA-scale currents, and less than 100 fs durations will be utilised to generate driver-witness pairs by using a mask in a dispersive section. In this contribution the physics case and the current status of the {FLASHForward} X-2 experiment are reviewed. The experimental installation is described, with a focus on the electron beamline. Electron beam dynamics and particle-in-cell simulations are presented. },

The obtained results are then compared to particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations as well as results obtained using an semi-analytic numerical approach ({SANA}) (Mehrling et al., 2016).

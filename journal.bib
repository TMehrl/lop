@article{Aschikhin:2015,
	Abstract = {Abstract The {FLASHForward} project at {DESY} is a pioneering plasma-wakefield acceleration experiment that aims to produce, in a few centimetres of ionised hydrogen, beams with energy of order GeV that are of quality sufficient to be used in a free-electron laser. The plasma is created by ionising a gas in a gas cell with a multi-TW laser system. The plasma wave will be driven by high-current-density electron beams from the {FLASH} linear accelerator. The laser system can also be used to provide optical diagnostics of the plasma and electron beams due to the &lt;30 fs synchronisation between the laser and the driving electron beam. The project will explore both external and internal witness-beam injection techniques. The operation parameters of the experiment are discussed, as well as the scientific programme. },

@article{Mehrling:2014,
	Abstract = {We introduce the Highly efficient Plasma Accelerator Emulation (HiPACE)
	code. It is a relativistic, electromagnetic, three-dimensional and
	fully parallelized particle-in-cell (PIC) code and uses the quasi-static
	approximation to efficiently simulate a variety of beam-driven plasma-wakefield
	acceleration scenarios. HiPACE exploits the disparity of time scales
	in the interaction of highly relativistic particle beams with plasma
	to decouple beam and plasma evolution. This enables time steps which
	are many times greater than those used in full PIC codes. Comparisons
	to the fully explicit PIC code OSIRIS show the capability of the
	quasi-static PIC code to consistently simulate problems in beam-driven
	plasma acceleration while reducing the required number of core hours
	by orders of magnitude. This work outlines the physical basis, describes
	the numerical implementation and assesses the parallel performance
	of the code which in combination lead to high computational efficiency.},

@article{Robson:2015,
	Abstract = {Abstract We formulate a new procedure for modelling the transverse
	dynamics of relativistic electron beams with significant energy spread
	when injected into plasma-based accelerators operated in the blow-out
	regime. Quantities of physical interest, such as the emittance, are
	furnished directly from solution of phase space moment equations
	formed from the relativistic Vlasov equation. The moment equations
	are closed by an Ansatz, and solved analytically for prescribed wakefields.
	The accuracy of the analytic formulas is established by benchmarking
	against the results of a semi-analytic/numerical procedure which
	is described within the scope of this work, and results from a simulation
	with the 3D quasi-static \{PIC\} code HiPACE. },

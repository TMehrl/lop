  abstract  = {The hose instability is a long standing challenge for plasma-based accelerators. It is seeded by initial transverse asymmetries of the beam or plasma phase space distribution. The beam centroid displacement is thereby amplified during the propagation in the plasma, which can lead to an unstable acceleration process.
A witness beam can itself cause hosing and/or may be affected by the hosing of the drive beam. The accurate study of hosing including a witness beam is of utmost importance to facilitate stable plasma-based accelerators. In this contribution, we discuss novel methods for the mitigation of hosing and present a new model for the evolution of the plasma centroid, which enables the accurate investigation of the hose instability of drive and witness beam pair in the nonlinear blowout regime. This work enables more precise and comprehensive studies of hosing and hence, for the potential stabilization of future compact plasma-based accelerators.},

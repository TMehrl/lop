  abstract = {We introduce the Highly efficient Plasma Accelerator Emulation (HiPACE)
	code. It is a relativistic, electromagnetic, three-dimensional and
	fully parallelized particle-in-cell (PIC) code and uses the quasi-static
	approximation to efficiently simulate a variety of beam-driven plasma-wakefield
	acceleration scenarios. HiPACE exploits the disparity of time scales
	in the interaction of highly relativistic particle beams with plasma
	to decouple beam and plasma evolution. This enables time steps which
	are many times greater than those used in full PIC codes. Comparisons
	to the fully explicit PIC code OSIRIS show the capability of the
	quasi-static PIC code to consistently simulate problems in beam-driven
	plasma acceleration while reducing the required number of core hours
	by orders of magnitude. This work outlines the physical basis, describes
	the numerical implementation and assesses the parallel performance
	of the code which in combination lead to high computational efficiency.},

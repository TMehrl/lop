The {PWFA} experiment at the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ) was launched to experimentally demonstrate and study the self-modulation of long electron beams in plasma. Key aspects for the experiment are the very flexible photocathode laser system, a plasma cell and well-developed beam diagnostics. In this contribution we report about the plasma cell design, preparatory experiments and the results of the first \{PWFA\} experiment at PITZ. },

High-quality 1 GeV-class electron beams from the free-electron laser FLASH with μm-emittances, kA-scale currents, and less than 100 fs durations will be utilised to generate driver–witness pairs by using a mask in a dispersive section. In this contribution the physics case and the current status of the FLASHForward X-2 experiment are reviewed. The experimental installation is described, with a focus on the electron beamline.

The \{SANA\} method is used to model the beam emittance evolution when injected into and extracted from realistic plasma profiles. Results are compared to particle-in-cell simulations, establishing the accuracy and efficiency of the procedure. In addition, it is demonstrated that the tapering of vacuum-to-plasma and plasma-to-vacuum transitions is a viable method for the mitigation of emittance growth of beams during their injection and extraction from and into plasma cells. },

The obtained results are then compared to particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations as well as results obtained using an semi-analytic numerical approach (SANA) (Mehrling et al., 2016).

The plasma is created by ionising a gas in a gas cell with a multi-TW laser system. The plasma wave will be driven by high-current-density electron beams from the {FLASH} linear accelerator. The laser system can also be used to provide optical diagnostics of the plasma and electron beams due to the &lt;30 fs synchronisation between the laser and the driving electron beam. The project will explore both external and internal witness-beam injection techniques. The operation parameters of the experiment are discussed, as well as the scientific programme.},

Acceleration of electrons in such fields may produce ultra-relativistic, quasi-monoenergetic, ultra-short electron bunches over distances orders of magnitudes shorter than in state-of-the-art radio-frequency accelerators. FLASHForward is a beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) project at DESY with the goal of producing, characterizing, and utilizing such beams. Temporal characterization of the acceleration process is of crucial importance for improving the stability and control in PWFA beams. While measurement of the transient field of the femtosecond bunch in a single shot is challenging, in recent years novel techniques with great promise have been developed [1, 2]. This work discusses the plans and status of the transverse diagnostics at FLASHForward.},

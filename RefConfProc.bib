The {PWFA} experiment at the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ) was launched to experimentally demonstrate and study the self-modulation of long electron beams in plasma. Key aspects for the experiment are the very flexible photocathode laser system, a plasma cell and well-developed beam diagnostics. In this contribution we report about the plasma cell design, preparatory experiments and the results of the first \{PWFA\} experiment at PITZ. },

  abstract = {Abstract Beam quality preservation in the external injection scheme is one of the key missing milestones towards staging of plasma-wakefield accelerators, a prerequisite for their utilisation in particle physics or other applications requiring high energy beams. This topic will be studied at FLASHForward, a unique beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration facility currently under construction at {DESY} (Hamburg, Germany), in the frame of the {FLASHForward} X-2 experiment. High-quality 1 GeV-class electron beams from the free-electron laser {FLASH} with $\mu$m-emittances, kA-scale currents, and less than 100 fs durations will be utilised to generate driver-witness pairs by using a mask in a dispersive section. In this contribution the physics case and the current status of the {FLASHForward} X-2 experiment are reviewed. The experimental installation is described, with a focus on the electron beamline. Electron beam dynamics and particle-in-cell simulations are presented. },

The \{SANA\} method is used to model the beam emittance evolution when injected into and extracted from realistic plasma profiles. Results are compared to particle-in-cell simulations, establishing the accuracy and efficiency of the procedure. In addition, it is demonstrated that the tapering of vacuum-to-plasma and plasma-to-vacuum transitions is a viable method for the mitigation of emittance growth of beams during their injection and extraction from and into plasma cells. },

This formalism is then applied to two scenarios with increasing complexity –a single beam slice without energy gain and a single beam slice with energy gain, both propagating at a fixed co-moving position behind the driver. The obtained results are then compared to particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations as well as results obtained using an semi-analytic numerical approach ({SANA}) (Mehrling et al., 2016). We find excellent agreement between results from the analytical model and from {SANA} and PIC. },

The plasma is created by ionising a gas in a gas cell with a multi-TW laser system. The plasma wave will be driven by high-current-density electron beams from the {FLASH} linear accelerator. The laser system can also be used to provide optical diagnostics of the plasma and electron beams due to the &lt;30 fs synchronisation between the laser and the driving electron beam. The project will explore both external and internal witness-beam injection techniques. The operation parameters of the experiment are discussed, as well as the scientific programme.},

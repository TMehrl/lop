  abstract = {We present particle-in-cell simulations with the code OSIRIS for future
	laser-plasma wakefield experiments with external bunch injection
	at the REGAE accelerator at DESY. The topics of particular interest
	are: emittance evolution of electron bunches and longitudinal bunch
	compression inside the wakefield. Results show significant transverse
	emittance growth during the injection process, if the electron bunch
	is not matched to its intrinsic betatron motion inside the wakefield.
	In addition, when externally injected at the zero-field crossing
	of the laser-driven wake, the electron bunch may undergo significant
	compression in longitudinal direction and simultaneously be accelerated
	due to the gradient in the accelerating field. This mechanism would
	allow for production of high-energy, ultra-short (on the order of
	one femtosecond) bunches at REGAE.},

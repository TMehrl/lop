  Abstract                 = {We present particle-in-cell simulations with the code OSIRIS for future laser-plasma wakefield experiments with external bunch injection at the REGAE accelerator at DESY. The topics of particular interest are: emittance evolution of electron bunches and longitudinal bunch compression inside the wakefield. Results show significant transverse emittance growth during the injection process, if the electron bunch is not matched to its intrinsic betatron motion inside the wakefield. In addition, when externally injected at the zero-field crossing of the laser-driven wake, the electron bunch may undergo significant compression in longitudinal direction and simultaneously be accelerated due to the gradient in the accelerating field. This mechanism would allow for production of high-energy, ultra-short (on the order of one femtosecond) bunches at REGAE.},

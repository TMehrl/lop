  abstract   = {We introduce the Highly efficient Plasma Accelerator Emulation (HiPACE) code. It is a relativistic, electromagnetic, three-dimensional and fully parallelized particle-in-cell (PIC) code and uses the quasi-static approximation to efficiently simulate a variety of beam-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration scenarios. HiPACE exploits the disparity of time scales in the interaction of highly relativistic particle beams with plasma to decouple beam and plasma evolution. This enables time steps which are many times greater than those used in full PIC codes. Comparisons to the fully explicit PIC code OSIRIS show the capability of the quasi-static PIC code to consistently simulate problems in beam-driven plasma acceleration while reducing the required number of core hours by orders of magnitude. This work outlines the physical basis, describes the numerical implementation and assesses the parallel performance of the code which in combination lead to high computational efficiency.},

  abstract   = {Abstract We formulate a new procedure for modelling the transverse dynamics of relativistic electron beams with significant energy spread when injected into plasma-based accelerators operated in the blow-out regime. Quantities of physical interest, such as the emittance, are furnished directly from solution of phase space moment equations formed from the relativistic Vlasov equation. The moment equations are closed by an Ansatz, and solved analytically for prescribed wakefields. The accuracy of the analytic formulas is established by benchmarking against the results of a semi-analytic/numerical procedure which is described within the scope of this work, and results from a simulation with the 3D quasi-static \{PIC\} code HiPACE. },

  abstract={In 1867, just two years after laying the foundations of electromagnetism, J. Clerk Maxwell presented a fundamental paper on kinetic gas theory, in which he described the evolution of the gas in terms of certain ‘moments’ of its velocity distribution function. This inspired Ludwig Boltzmann to formulate his famous kinetic equation, from which followed the H -theorem and the connection with entropy. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of publication of Maxwell's paper, we review the Maxwell–Boltzmann formalism and discuss how its generality and adaptability enable it to play a key role in describing the behaviour of a variety of systems of current interest, in both gaseous and condensed matter, and in modern-day physics and technologies which Maxwell and Boltzmann could not possibly have foreseen. In particular, we illustrate the relevance and applicability of Maxwell's formalism to the dynamic field of plasma-wakefield acceleration.}

It is a relativistic, electromagnetic, three-dimensional and fully parallelized particle-in-cell (PIC) code and uses the quasi-static approximation to efficiently simulate a variety of beam-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration scenarios. HiPACE exploits the disparity of time scales in the interaction of highly relativistic particle beams with plasma to decouple beam and plasma evolution. This enables time steps which are many times greater than those used in full PIC codes. Comparisons to the fully explicit PIC code OSIRIS show the capability of the quasi-static PIC code to consistently simulate problems in beam-driven plasma acceleration while reducing the required number of core hours by orders of magnitude. This work outlines the physical basis, describes the numerical implementation and assesses the parallel performance of the code which in combination lead to high computational efficiency.},

  abstract   = {Abstract We formulate a new procedure for modelling the transverse dynamics of relativistic electron beams with significant energy spread when injected into plasma-based accelerators operated in the blow-out regime. Quantities of physical interest, such as the emittance, are furnished directly from solution of phase space moment equations formed from the relativistic Vlasov equation. The moment equations are closed by an Ansatz, and solved analytically for prescribed wakefields. The accuracy of the analytic formulas is established by benchmarking against the results of a semi-analytic/numerical procedure which is described within the scope of this work, and results from a simulation with the 3D quasi-static \{PIC\} code HiPACE. },

  abstract={In 1867, just two years after laying the foundations of electromagnetism, J. Clerk Maxwell presented a fundamental paper on kinetic gas theory, in which he described the evolution of the gas in terms of certain ‘moments’ of its velocity distribution function. This inspired Ludwig Boltzmann to formulate his famous kinetic equation, from which followed the H -theorem and the connection with entropy. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of publication of Maxwell's paper, we review the Maxwell–Boltzmann formalism and discuss how its generality and adaptability enable it to play a key role in describing the behaviour of a variety of systems of current interest, in both gaseous and condensed matter, and in modern-day physics and technologies which Maxwell and Boltzmann could not possibly have foreseen. In particular, we illustrate the relevance and applicability of Maxwell's formalism to the dynamic field of plasma-wakefield acceleration.}

  abstract = {To understand astrophysical magnetic-field amplification, we conducted a feasibility study for a laboratory experiment of a non-resonant streaming instability at the Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ). This non-resonant streaming instability, also known as Bell’s instability, is generally regarded as a candidate for the amplification of interstellar magnetic field in the upstream region of supernova-remnant shocks, which is crucial for the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration. In the beam-plasma system composed of a radio-frequency electron gun and a gas-discharge plasma cell, the goal of our experiment is to demonstrate the development of the non-resonant streaming instability and to find its saturation level in the laboratory environment. Since we find that the electron beam will be significantly decelerated on account of an electrostatic streaming instability, which will decrease the growth rate of desired non-resonant streaming instability, we discuss possible ways to suppress the electrostatic streaming instability by considering the characteristics of a field-emission-based quasi continuous-wave electron beam.},

  abstract = { The FLASHForward experimental facility is a high-performance test-bed for precision plasma wakefield research, aiming to accelerate high-quality electron beams to GeV-levels in a few centimetres of ionized gas. The plasma is created by ionizing gas in a gas cell either by a high-voltage discharge or a high-intensity laser pulse. The electrons to be accelerated will either be injected internally from the plasma background or externally from the FLASH superconducting RF front end. In both cases, the wakefield will be driven by electron beams provided by the FLASH gun and linac modules operating with a 10 Hz macro-pulse structure, generating 1.25 GeV, 1 nC electron bunches at up to 3 MHz micro-pulse repetition rates. At full capacity, this FLASH bunch-train structure corresponds to 30 kW of average power, orders of magnitude higher than drivers available to other state-of-the-art LWFA and PWFA experiments. This high-power functionality means FLASHForward is the only plasma wakefield facility in the world with the immediate capability to develop, explore and benchmark high-average-power plasma wakefield research essential for next-generation facilities. The operational parameters and technical highlights of the experiment are discussed, as well as the scientific goals and high-average-power outlook.
